  <h2>The NOCOM_BOT Core Utilities (coreutils) Repository</h2>
</div>

This is the NOCOM_BOT coreutils repository, where you can find some much needed utilities but doesn't fit in the core/kernel.

In theory, you could build NOCOM_BOT from scratch without coreutils, but many stuff if it does require coreutils wouldn't work at all.

**PLEASE NOTE**: This software is in alpha (stage 1), bugs are expected to be found.
